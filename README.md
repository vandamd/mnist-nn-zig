# Neural Network in Zig, from scratch

## Note (08/01/25)

This is my first bits of code for Zig. I'd never used Zig before and thought creating a neural network would be pretty fun!

I've always wanted to fully understand the mathematical concepts behind neural networks, so here we are!

Implementation isn't quite finished - it's a bit too slow lol

I'm gonna get to optimising it more next...
